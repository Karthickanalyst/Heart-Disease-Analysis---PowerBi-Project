# 🫀 Heart Disease Analysis with Power BI

This Power BI project analyzes medical data to explore trends and patterns related to heart disease. The aim is to build a dynamic dashboard that enables healthcare professionals and stakeholders to derive insights that could support early diagnosis and preventive measures.

## 📁 Project Description

This project was developed as part of a Power BI training initiative, focusing on real-world data analysis, visualization, and dashboard design. The heart disease dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains various patient health metrics which have been cleaned, transformed, and visualized using Power BI.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: [Heart Disease Dataset on Kaggle]
- **Content**: Patient records including age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol, heart rate, and target variable indicating presence or absence of heart disease.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Transformation

Performed using **Power Query Editor**:
- Handled missing values
- Removed duplicates and irrelevant columns
- Renamed and standardized column headers
- Converted data types appropriately

## 🔢 DAX Functions Used

At least 10 DAX expressions were implemented to derive custom metrics, including:
- `SUM()`
- `AVERAGE()`
- `COUNT()`
- `DISTINCTCOUNT()`
- `IF()`
- `CALCULATE()`
- `DATEADD()`
- `ALL()`
- `RELATED()`
- `SWITCH()`

## 📈 Dashboard Features

The Power BI dashboard includes:
- Interactive visualizations: Bar chart, Pie chart, Line graph, and Cards
- Filters and slicers for age, sex, and cholesterol levels
- KPIs highlighting patients with high heart disease risk
- Clean layout with a user-friendly interface

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Males over 50 had a significantly higher likelihood of heart disease.
- High cholesterol and resting blood pressure strongly correlated with heart disease.
- Most patients with heart disease showed abnormal ECG results and elevated heart rate.

## 💡 Recommendations

- Encourage regular health checkups for at-risk age groups
- Target awareness campaigns towards high-risk patients
- Use predictive analytics for early heart disease diagnosis

## 🖥️ Presentation

A PowerPoint presentation was also created summarizing:
- Project overview
- Dataset insights
- Data cleaning steps
- DAX usage
- Final dashboard walkthrough
- Key takeaways and recommendations
